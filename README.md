# Non-deterministic-Finite-State-Automata-NFA-with-epsilon-transition
The objective of this project is to simulate Non-deterministic Finite State Automata (NFA) with epsilon transition. The inputs to the simulation are: 1. Alphabet 2. Number of states in NFA 3. Start state(s) 4. Final state(s) 5. Transition function (from_state, symbol, to_state)
